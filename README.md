## Installation

```bash
# Add marketplace
/plugin marketplace add lklimek/agents

# Browse available plugins
/plugin

# Install individual plugins

/plugin install claudius@lklimek
/plugin install memcan@lklimek
```

## For project teams

Auto-install the marketplace when team members open your repository by adding
to `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "lklimek": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "lklimek/agents"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Updating

```bash
/plugin marketplace update
```

Plugins are fetched from their source repositories. Updating the marketplace
refreshes the catalog; individual plugins update independently.

## Architecture

```
lklimek/agents          ← this repo (marketplace catalog)
  ├── claudash           → lklimek/claudash (Dash Platform skills)
  ├── claudius           → lklimek/claudius (dev lifecycle toolkit)
  └── memcan             → lklimek/memcan (persistent memory)
```

Each plugin lives in its own repository with independent versioning. This
marketplace is a lightweight catalog pointing to them — no plugin code lives
here.
